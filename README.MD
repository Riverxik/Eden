# Eden Programming Language

**WARNING! Eden language is still in development stage.**

Eden is object-oriented programming language written in Java. 
Main goal for this project is make a simple oop self-hosted language.
Just because it's fun, and I can (can I?).

Eden is planned to be:
- [ ] Compiled
- [ ] Turing-complete
- [ ] Self-hosted (Java is used only as an initial bootstrap, once the language is mature enough I'm going to rewrite it in itself)
